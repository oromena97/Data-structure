Problem 1 - Solution with an array:

Define two arrays: set1 and set2.
Initialize an empty array named 'distinct_elements'.
Loop through each element of set1 and set2 and check if it is present in the 'distinct_elements' array. If it is not present in the array, then add the element to it and also add the element to the 'sum' variable.
Return the value of 'sum'.
Here's the algorithm:

Function sumDistinct(set1, set2)
    distinct_elements = []
    sum = 0

    For element in set1:
        If element not in distinct_elements:
            Append element to distinct_elements
            Add element to sum

    For element in set2:
        If element not in distinct_elements:
            Append element to distinct_elements
            Add element to sum

    Return sum
End Function

Problem 2 - Solution with an array and a procedure:

Define a procedure named 'dot_product' that takes two arrays as parameters and returns the dot product of the two vectors.
Define a function named 'is_orthogonal' that takes two arrays as parameters and calls the 'dot_product' procedure to find the dot product of the two vectors.
If the dot product is zero, return True (vectors are orthogonal) else return False.
Loop through each pair of vectors and call the 'is_orthogonal' function to determine if they are orthogonal.
Here's the algorithm:

Procedure dot_product(vector1, vector2)
    sum = 0

    For i = 0 to vector1.length-1:
        product = vector1[i] * vector2[i]
        sum = sum + product

    Return sum
End Procedure

Function is_orthogonal(vector1, vector2)
    dot_product_value = dot_product(vector1, vector2)

    If dot_product_value == 0:
        Return True
    Else:
        Return False
End Function

    For i = 0 to vectors.length-1:
        For j = i+1 to vectors.length-1:
            If is_orthogonal(vectors[i], vectors[j]):
                Print "Vectors", vectors[i], "and", vectors[j], "are orthogonal"
            Else:
                Print "Vectors", vectors[i], "and", vectors[j], "are not orthogonal"
    End For
